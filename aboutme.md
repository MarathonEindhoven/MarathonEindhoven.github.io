Is it possible to take sports measurements from a video made with your mobile phone? In a controlled laboratory environment we can measure the heart rate from video. Building on this research, Radboudumc and TU Delft are now focusing on estimating body temperature, heart rate, and breathing from videos in an uncontrolled and realistic environment: the Marathon Eindhoven 2019. To make this study possible, we need your need help. You can make video recordings of participants of the Marathon Eindhoven at any given moment and then share them with the research team by clicking on the 'upload data' button below. Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
